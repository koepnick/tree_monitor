# tree_monitor
A very simple MicroPython program to monitor my poor hibiscus tree.

Forgot to make this private and am too lazy to fix it. Maybe this will be of use to somebody.

This assumes that [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) is installed and on your path, and that the MicroPython firmware is already installed on your device.
